# Deal-my-car


Project intuition and reasoning:

Everyone knows that car dealerships (especially used ones) leverage market info against their customers to extract an extremely high profit margin from both their sales and purchases of vehicles.
They will value your trade-in at no more than 30% it's market value and you will let it go because you are just excited to get a new car and bored of your old one.
I decided to take on this project that I named "Deal my car" to help people see what a dealer would try to sell their car at after they accept it as a trade in.


Overview of work done:

In this project I went through:

- Scraping car data from Kijiji ads posted by dealerships in the Calgary area
- Cleaning the data
- Performing some EDA to identify key features and trends
- Selecting and training a regression model
- Creating a clunky UI for people to see what dealers would price their cars at (will develop a nicer front-end API soon)
